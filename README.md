###Lessons Learned
This project helpped solidify my understanding of interfaces, APIE and allowed me to broaden my understanding of how java works as a whole, however i found that i was still lacking in comprehension that would allow me to create this faster, Thanks to my cohortmate Anthony,Lucas and Andrew as well as TA's Ashley and Will for guiding me and furthering my understanding of java.
issues i had while creating the program is creating connections between classses and methods while utilizing ArrayList. creating logic that would allow the program to run was also challenging.
